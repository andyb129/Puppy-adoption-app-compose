## :scroll: Description
Adopt a Pup is a simple app to browse for amazing dogs ready for a new home!

( All UI is written in Compose for week 1 of the Android Dev Challenge: Compose

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Exited to learn as much as I can of the new Android UI toolkit Compose, and creating a simple app
like this is a great start to the journey
